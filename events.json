It\n follows the lives of 25 children, born at the beginning of the 21st \ncentury, as they grow from infancy, through childhood, and on to \nbecoming young adults.</p><p>The aim of the series is to build up a coherent and scientifically \naccurate picture of how the genes and the environment of growing \nchildren interact to make a fully formed adult. A large portion of the \nseries is made up of experiments designed to examine these questions. \nThe main topic under consideration is: \"Are we born or are we made?\". \nThe nature of the family in contemporary Britain is also addressed.</p><p>The project is planned to run for 20 years, following its subjects \nfrom birth until the age of 20. During the first half of its run a set \nof about three or four episodes was produced annually. After 2008 new \nepisodes became less frequent, and in 2011 there was some doubt about \nthe future of the programme, including from Winston himself. In February\n 2013 it was announced that the series would resume, with two new \nepisodes presented by Winston. Rather than the psychological experiments\n of previous series, these episodes focused on the first interviews with\n the participating children themselves and their families.</p>","updated":1491095217,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/6475"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1110298"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1110298"}}},{"id":1111206,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1111206/play-to-the-whistle-3x06-episode-6","name":"Episode 6","season":3,"number":6,"airdate":"2017-04-04","airtime":"21:00","airstamp":"2017-04-04T21:00:00+01:00","runtime":60,"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_landscape/103/259485.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/103/259485.jpg"},"summary":"<p>On Frank's team this week will be Queen of the Jungle Scarlett Moffatt and Frank's regular wingman comedian Romesh Ranganathan and joining Bradley will be comedian Rob Beckett and golfer Andrew Johnston.</p><p>Comedian Seann Walsh is back to help Holly maintain order and to keep score as both teams simply…Play To The Whistle.</p>","show":{"id":11162,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/11162/play-to-the-whistle","name":"Play to the Whistle","type":"Game Show","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Family"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2015-04-11","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Tuesday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":{"id":35,"name":"ITV","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":294684,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/64/161817.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/64/161817.jpg"},"summary":"<p><strong>Play to the Whistle</strong> is a British comedy panel game show that airs on ITV with the first episode broadcast on 11 April 2015.</p><p>In each episode two teams of three compete in sports knowledge rounds and physical games to achieve points for their teams, at the end the team with the most points is declared the winner.</p><p>The show is hosted by Holly Willoughby.
